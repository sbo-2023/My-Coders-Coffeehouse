# My-Coders-Coffeehouse
This is my version of the Coders coffeehouse project from Code Institute.<br>
The original version was built through challenges using the "Playground" along the "HTML Essential" module.<br>
There wasn't any deployed site nor interactivity, for instance, the form "WIN free coffee" couldn't be submitted.
The website structure was mainly made up of `<div>`.<br>
Most of the code was provided by CI.<br>
In my version:
- I've  written all of the code using semantic elements such as  `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.
- I've added some features like a "back to top" button, a 404 page.
