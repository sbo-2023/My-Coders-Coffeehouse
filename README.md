# My-Coders-Coffeehouse
This is my version of the Coders coffeehouse project from Code Institute.<br>
The original version was built through challenges using the "Playground" along the "HTML Essential" module.<br>
There wasn't any deployed site nor interactivity, for instance, the form "WIN free coffee" couldn't be submitted.
The website structure was mainly made up of `<div>`.<br>
Most of the code was provided by CI.<br>
In my version:
- I've  written all of the code using semantic elements such as  `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.
- I've added some features like a "back to top" button, a 404 page.
- I plan to add interactivity for submitting the form and giving feedback to the user.
- I use Agile for the project management.

By removing the form, this could be a static website.

This repository might be used as starting point for:
- styling the website with vanilla CSS
- styling the website with Bootstrap
- adding interactivity using Javascript
- adding interactivity using jQuery
- creating the site with django
- creating the site with React

## Project goal
Practicing the languages, frameworks and libraries mentioned above.

## Testing
